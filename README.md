A simple prototype testing the capabilities of Dash + Plotly

The grouper-prototype notebook spawns a Dash app that allows the user to view and group individual trajectories for the result of a single GillesPy2 ensemble simulation. The "Assign to group" dropdown will place the trajectory into one of several groups (5 by default, this can be changed in cell 2).

The second section of the interface shows the mean value of each species in the group trajectories.
